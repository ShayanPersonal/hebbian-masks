modify wide resnet or densenet so when there's 256 filters the group size on 3x3 is 256, then 1x1 to merge them together.
make the weights of the 1x1 and fully connected positive only, use concatenated relu
add hebbian learning mask on top of fully connected and 1x1 weights? might not be necessary if weights are positive only.

connections should be adjusted with hebbian learning during test time?

residual connections are just a form of attention?
